# StellarPets
This project is a fully developed Android application created through collaborative teamwork. Using Android Studio and Java, we designed and implemented a unique gaming experience that combines a Tetris-like game with a virtual pet simulation. The gameplay challenges users to strategically play the Tetris-like game to help their virtual pet survive and thrive across various levels and increasing difficulties. The application's engaging mechanics and seamless integration of puzzle-solving with pet care provide a fresh twist on classic gaming genres. This project highlights teamwork, creativity, and technical proficiency in Android development to deliver a fun and interactive user experience.
